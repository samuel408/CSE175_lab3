# heuristic.py
#
# This Python script file provides two functions in support of minimax search
# using the expected value of game states. First, the file provides the
# function "expected_value_over_delays". This function takes as an argument
# a state of game play in which the current player has just selected an
# action. The function calculates the expected value of the state over all
# possible random results determining the amount of time before the
# Guardian changes gaze direction. This function calculates this value
# regardless of whose turn it is. The value of game states that result from
# different random outcomes is determined by calling "value". Second, the
# file provides a heuristic evaluation function for non-terminal game states.
# The heuristic value returned is between "max_payoff" (best for the
# computer player) and negative one times that value (best for the opponent).
# The heuristic function may be applied to any state of play. It uses
# features of the game state to predict the game payoff without performing
# any look-ahead search.
